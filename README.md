Bank Loan Eligibility Checker is a Python-based command-line application that simulates a basic pre-qualification process for bank loans. Designed with user interaction in mind, this tool helps applicants determine their eligibility for various types of loans — including personal, gold, and consumer loans — based on key financial and personal parameters such as age, nationality, employment status, monthly income, loan amount, credit score, and gold purity (for gold loans).

The program implements a rule-based decision system that guides users through a series of questions, evaluates their responses, and provides real-time feedback on their eligibility. It includes detailed validation, dynamic messaging, and realistic banking rules — making it both an educational tool for Python learners and a functional prototype for early-stage financial applications.
